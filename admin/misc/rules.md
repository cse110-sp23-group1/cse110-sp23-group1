<a name="br2"></a>**Scheduling Meetings**

● Fridays from 4-5 pm are the only mandatory meetings. ○ We prefer in-person meetings, but will have a Discord open to those who can’t make it in-person.

● People are welcome to come earlier/leave at a later time if they choose to do so, as long as they attend the 4-5pm one.

● There may be additional “work session” meetings throughout the week that can

be hybrid, only if needed.

**General Responsibilities for All Team Members**

**Dividing up work**

● Prioritize your own work first, then help others if possible.● Just do your part and help each other if you can. Don’t be afraid to help in other roles (ex. If you are a developer, you don’t only have to be a developer, you can also plan, design, etc.)

● Send a message on Slack if you encounter any issues during development and other team members would try and help out.

● If you need additional help/can’t finish an assigned task on time please reach out

to other team members on Slack so that other team members can take over.

**Github Issues and Templates**

**●** Source: [**https://rewind.com/blog/best-practices-for-using-github-issues/**](https://rewind.com/blog/best-practices-for-using-github-issues/)● Github Issues should be used whenever we are developing a feature for our project or reporting bugs in the program

● Use templates that separates requesting features and reporting bugs.● Whenever you open an issue, mention the specific people involved so that they will not miss the issue

● Use labels to organize issues better

**Github Actions**

● Learn how to handle commits, branches, merge requests, reviews.

○ We will find what works best for us as the quarter progresses.

**Conflict Resolution**

● Treat each other with respect, disagreements are not the same as conflicts.● If any issues arise, reach out to a team leader.

● If the issue escalates, we can go to a TA/Professor.

● If a member is not meeting deadlines or not carrying their weight, team leaders

will reach out and try to cooperate as much as they can so the issue can beresolved.
