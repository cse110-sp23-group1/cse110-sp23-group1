# Choosing our style of Fortune Telling: The Origami Fortune Teller

## Context and Problem Statement
Problem: There are multiple different ways to tell a fortune. Many examples that come to mind include Tarot Cards, Tea Leaves, Magic 8 Balls, Astrology, Horoscopes, etc. We must choose the fortune teller of our liking that would best represent how we want to represent fortunes.

## Decision Drivers

* Easy to implement
* Interesting choice that is is not similar to other fortune tellers
* Attractive enough for potential users to want to use our app

## Considered Options

* Health Tracking App
* Stock Predicting App
* Weather Predicting App
* Magic 8 Ball
* Astrology
* Crystal Ball
* Flipping a Coin
* Tarot Cards
* Palm Readers
* Omikuji
* Chinese sticks
* Fortune Cookies
* Origami Fortune Teller
* Chinese Zodiac Signs
* Tea Leaves
* Throwing Bones

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Origami Fortune Teller.
This option was chosen because it seemed to be a nostalgic choice among group members as many members have used these in elementary school to predict fortunes. We used to write 8 fortunes on the a piece of paper, fold it up, and ask our friends to play. In addition, the easy of implementation seemed to stand out to us. Other options would require skills or a database of fortunes out of scope for our knowledge. Finally, the nostalgic element also comes in play when attracting potential users to try our app out. Since we found that this implementation is not so common, it would also help to make our app unique.
