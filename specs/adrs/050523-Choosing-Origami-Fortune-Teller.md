## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Origami Fortune Teller.
This option was chosen because it seemed to be a nostalgic choice among group members as many members have used these in elementary school to predict fortunes. We used to write 8 fortunes on the a piece of paper, fold it up, and ask our friends to play. In addition, the easy of implementation seemed to stand out to us. Other options would require skills or a database of fortunes out of scope for our knowledge.
