# Ditching Animate Button

## Context and Problem Statement

The animate button was initially thought about to allow the user to start the fortune teller. However, we eventually decided to go with an alternative method.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* UI should not be too cluttered with too many buttons
* Minimize the number of clicks it takes to start the fortune teller.
* Hover function seems much cleaner than a button

## Considered Options

* Start animation after user clicks animate button. They would click on a flap first, then the button.
* Do not use the button and instead allow the user to just click on the flaps to start the animation.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to drop the animate button and opt to let the user click on a flap to start the animation instead.

### Consequences

* Good, because it requires less coding for the developers.
* Good, because it will require less clicks for the user to start the actual process of the fortune teller.
* Good, because the UI will have less clutter lying around.
* Good, because the hover function makes our site looks nicer and more legit.

## Validation

This decision was discussion in #week-9-sprint in Slack and officially voted on in #general in Slack. Decision was agreed upon by full team in the poll.
